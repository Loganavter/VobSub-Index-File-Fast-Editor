VobSub Index File Fast Editor is a toolkit for fast work with VobSub index files, it is much easier and faster to make general changes with them. There is also the ability to quickly batch process all files in a folder. It does not have full functionality, that is, you cannot quickly change any parameters of your index files, except for resolving and increasing or decreasing the delay for all timestamps in the file. And additionally, the program is able to pull out and save all VobSub subtitle files from .mkv files. I considered the rest of the functionality unnecessary in the context of the intended use of this program. In this case, I initially made it to suit my needs - fitting subtitles from dvdrip to another higher-quality video version than in dvdrip, but with identical playback time. If someone needs more functionality, then write about it in the suggestions thread. Maybe I will do it if I see a demand for it.

## How to use GUI
---
The interaction is very clear, so I won't go into details, I just want to mention that drag'n'drop functionality is implemented on the "Select Folder", "Browse" and "Extract subtitles" buttons.

##### etc. Through pain, sweat and tears, I wrote the program code entirely in a week using ChatGPT. I'm dumb, I know.
